> Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is an NTFS (New Technology File System) file attribute and
  was designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS (Hierarchical File System).
> Any file created on an NTFS formatted drive will have two different forks/streams:
  > Data stream - Default stream that contains the data of the file.
  > Resource stream - Typically contains the metadata of the file.
> Attackers can use ADS to hide malicious code or executables in legitimate files in order to
  evade detection.
> This can be done by storing the malicious code or executables in the file attribute resource
  stream (metadata) of a legitimate file.
> This technique is usually used to evade basic signature based AVs and static scanning tools.

Alternate Data Streams Practical:
> cmd.exe
  > notepad <file>                      // create file
  > Basic Insert, then safe
    > Datastream
    
  > right-klick on file > properties > details
  
> notepad <file>:<secret>               // hidden content in resource stream
