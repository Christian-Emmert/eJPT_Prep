> market share >= 70% in 2021
> popularity = target for attackers
> MS08-067(Conflicker) / MS17-010(EternalBlue)

> older Versions have Vulns, which are fixed in newer versions (EOL of Support)
> written in C > buffer overflow, arbitrary code execution
> not configured to run securely after install per default
> Zero Day not patched immediately by Microsoft / often missed patches

> companies use older versions when new version is released > possibility for atatck surface
> vulnerable to cross vulns > SQL Injections
> vulnerable to physical attacks > theft, bad usbs

> Information disclosure - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to access
  confidential data.
> Buffer overflows - Caused by a programming error, allows attackers to write data
  to a buffer and overrun the allocated buffer, consequently writing data to
  allocated memory addresses.
> Remote code execution - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to remotely execute
  code on the target system.
> Privilege escalation - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to elevate their
  privileges after initial compromise.
> Denial of Service (DOS) - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to consume a
  system/hostâ€™s resources (CPU, RAM, Network etc) consequently preventing the
