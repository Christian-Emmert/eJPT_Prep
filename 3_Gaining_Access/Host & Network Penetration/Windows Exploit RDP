> The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary GUI remote access
  protocol developed by Microsoft and is used to remotely connect and interact
  with a Windows system.
> RDP uses TCP port 3389 by default, and can also be configured to run on any
  other TCP port.
> RDP authentication requires a legitimate user account on the target system as
  well as the userâ€™s password in clear-text.
> We can perform an RDP brute-force attack to identify legitimate user
  credentials that we can use to gain remote access to the target system.
  
  
> RDP Brute Force Attack:
> nmap -sV -p- <IP>
  > RDP can be configured on another port
  > check RDP port:
    > service postegresql start && msfconsole -q
      > search rdp_scanner
        > use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
          > set RHOSTS <IP>
          > set RPORT <Port found from nmap>
          > run
            > Detected RDP means RDP Port found
